    <h2>Ingredents</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4lbs Chicken Wings</li>
        <li>Nonstick Cooking Spray</li>
        <li>2 TSP Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>4 TSP Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Melted Butter</li>
        <li>2 TBSP Lemon Pepper Seasoning</li>
        <li>2 TBSP Honey</li>
        <li>1 TBSP Hot Sauce</li>
        <li>2 TSP Fresh Lemon Juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil and top each with a wire rack. Spray the racks with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Stir together the salt and baking powder in a large bowl. Add the chicken wings and toss until evenly coated. Divide the wings evenly between the prepared racks, leaving space between wings. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate, uncovered, for up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450Â°F with the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. If the wings were refrigerated, let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake the wings for 25 minutes. Flip the wings over and rotate the baking sheets from upper and lower oven racks. Continue baking the wings until crispy and golden, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the wings are baking, stir together the butter, lemon pepper, honey, hot sauce and lemon juice in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Transfer the wings to the bowl with the butter mixture and toss to coat. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately with lemon wedges.</li>
