    <h2>Ingredents</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16oz Package of Dinner Rolls</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup of Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 TSP Dijon Mustard</li>
        <li>1 TBSP Chopped Pickle Jalapeno</li>
        <li>2 TSP Honey</li>
        <li>4oz Thinly Sliced Swiss Cheese</li>
        <li>8oz Thinly Sliced Ham</li>
        <li>4oz Thinly Sliced Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>1 TBSP Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 TSP Poppy Seeds</li>
        <li>1 TBSP Chopped Chives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the broiler on high. Remove the rolls from the packaging in one piece. With a serrated knife, cut crosswise through the center of the rolls at once, to divide the top half from the bottom (keeping the sides of the rolls intact). Place both halves cut side up on a baking sheet and broil for 1 to 2 minutes until lightly toasted. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 350˚F. Mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, jalapeños, and honey in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>On the same sheet tray, spread the cut sides of the rolls with the mayonnaise mixture. On the bottom sides of the rolls, lay out the Swiss cheese slices in a single layer, slightly overlapping if needed. Then, lay the ham slices in an even layer over top, followed by the cheddar cheese. Cover with the top half of the rolls.</li>
        <li>Brush the tops of the rolls all over with olive oil and sprinkle with poppy seeds. Cover the sheet tray and bake for 10 minutes. Uncover the tray and bake 10 to 15 more minutes or until the cheese is melted and the tops of the rolls are golden and toasted. Sprinkle all over with chives. Cut along the lines of the rolls into individual sliders and serve immediately.</li>
