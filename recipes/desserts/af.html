    <h2>Ingredents</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 TSP Baking Powder</li>
        <li>2 TBSP Ground Cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 1/4 TSP Salt</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup Whole Milk</li>
        <li>2 TBSP Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>2 TSP Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>2 Granny Smith Apples</li>
        <li>Powder Sugar (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a fork, then add milk, melted butter, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the dry and wet ingredients together until just combined (do not over mix.) Fold in the apples.</li>
        <li>Heat a couple of inches of canola oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. When it gets hot (about 350Â°F), drop a little drop of batter into the oil. If it sizzles immediately and rises to the top, the oil is ready; if it burns quickly, lower the heat.</li>
        <li>Drop 1 tablespoon of batter into the hot oil, 6 or 8 at a time. Sometimes they'll flip over by themselves; sometimes you have to flip them. Just watch them and make sure they don't get too brown, but cook them long enough to make sure the batter is cooked through, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes total. Repeat with the remaining batter. Remove the fritters and drain on a paper towel. </li>
        <li>For the glaze (if using): In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, salt, vanilla, and milk.</li>
        <li>Dust the fritters very generously with powdered sugar, or dip the fritters in the light doughnut glaze. Serve warm! </li>
    </ol>
