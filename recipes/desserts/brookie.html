    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking pan and line with parchment paper, leaving two sides longer, that hang about 2-inches over the long sides of the pan. </li>
        <li>For the brownie batter: Melt the butter on medium-low heat in a medium saucepan. Add the chopped chocolate, whisking occasionally until smooth and melted. Sprinkle in cocoa powder and instant coffee, and whisk to combine. Remove the pan from heat and let it cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in sugar, vanilla, egg, and egg yolk just until just combined. Add the flour and baking powder, and fold in with a rubber spatula just until incorporated. Set aside.</li>
        <li>For the cookie dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the butter and sugars. Beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until combined.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a small mixing bowl. Add to the butter mixture and beat just until incorporated. Reserve 1/4 cup of the chocolate chips, and mix the remainder into the cookie dough.</li>
        <li>Drop the cookie dough and brownie batter by heaping spoonfuls around the prepared pan, alternating the two types of dough. Gently tap the pan on the counter to settle the batter and close up any gaps. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes, then tent with foil and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Let the brookies cool completely in the pan, about 1 hour. Remove the brookies by pulling on the ends of the parchment paper and transfer them to a cutting board for easy slicing. </li>
